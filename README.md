# Serpentine Snake Robot
A biomorphic hyper-redundant snake robot capable of taversing different terrains using serpentine motion. It detects pests such as dummy rodents and scare them away using sound. It is based on ATmega328 microcontroller, which uses 10 servo motors(GS-5515MG) for the serpentine motion and colour sensor(TCS230) circuit for rodent detection.
The snake bot sense pests such as dummy rodents in in the arena using...,...., and shoos/scares it away using sound. (Any more details???
Think in the way what I would ask If want to see when I see it for the first time...)

A two-wheel self-balancing robot, based on the ATmega2560 micro-controller, which uses a Cascaded PID control architecture. Four PID controllers are implemented to control the position, velocity, rotation (measured using Quadrature Encoders) and the tilt angle (measured using GY80 Sensor) of the robot.
